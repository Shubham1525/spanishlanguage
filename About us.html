        <h4>    <span>Why mafalda spanish?</span></h4>
        <p class="text-muted">People study, learn and practice, and attend events with Battersea Spanish because they want to immerse themselves in this vibrant and colourful language and culture. People come to us full of desires to vacation abroad somewhere warm and sunny, engage with friends and loved ones, seek out new adventures, shake their hips, or simply enjoy life through food, music, dance and gathering.</p>
        
          <p class="text-muted">Mafalda Spanish helps community members fulfil those goals, here in London. We rescue members from the solitude of apps or impersonal overcrowded classes and immerse them in a unique learning experience. Our courses and events connect people in order to create a bi-lingual community that deepens members’ roots to Spain and Latin America.</p>
          <br><br>

          <p class="text-muted">With over a hundred 5-star reviews, from our database of nearly 10,000 Londoners – our method and service has led to us winning the LUKAS award for Best Language School in the UK as well as numerous accolades from the Wandsworth Small Business Awards.</p>

We welcome anyone looking for a different and rewarding Latin/Spanish experience!</p>
